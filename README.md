This Github repository accompanies the report to my final year project, 'Dust Devils Unleashed: Machine Learning Detection of Martian Whirlwinds'.

The main purpose of this repository is to provide accessibility to the catalogue of dust devil predictions generated for the second year of the InSight Mars mission. The catalogue can be found under ''. It contains 3 columns: the 'Sol' column and 'LTST' columns, containing the predicted time of the dust devils, and the 'Magnitude' column, containing their predicted pressure drop magnitude.

The relevant code used to generate the predictions catalogue can be found in the 'Code' folder.
